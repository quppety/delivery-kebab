# Delivery Kebab - Zero-Waste Sister App for Food Delivery Service

## Introduction

Delivery Kebab is a project we did in three days for Elbrus Bootcamp. It's a fun experiment to address the issue of unclaimed orders in food delivery apps. Couriers can place orders that went unclaimed with a discount. On the main page clients can see available orders listed by distance and purchase them at a discounted price.

## Features

- **Order Placement**: Couriers can place unclaimed orders in the app, specifying a discount to attract customers.

- **Order Listings**: Customers can view available orders listed by proximity to their location.

- **Order Purchase**: Customers can purchase discounted orders directly through the app.

- **Order Tracking**: Couriers can change and track the order status, customers can see the updated order status.
